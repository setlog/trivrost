# What files does trivrost create?
* Its executable file. (On MacOS, actually a `.app`-folder posing as an application, which is canon in the Mac world)
* All files of all bundles you define, stored in a folder called `bundles`.
* A lock-file `.lock` which is locked using the OS's file system API, to [prevent trivrost from racing with other instances of itself](dev/locking.md).
* A file `.launcher-lock` which contains information on the currently locking trivrost instance.
* A file `.execution-lock` which prevents trivrost from updating bundles while your application is running.
* A `timestamps.json` file used to protect against attacks.
* `.log`-files in a `log`-folder.
* A desktop shortcut to its binary.
* A Start menu shortcut to its binary.
* A Start menu shortcut to its binary with the `--uninstall` parameter.
* The icon you defined. (Linux only; required for shortcut to display icon)
