# trivrost
trivrost is a repurposable application-downloader and -launcher in the form of a native executable: it updates some files on a computer and executes a command afterwards, no questions asked. It can also update itself to introduce new features without the need for user interaction. See [reasons.md](docs/reasons.md) for more background information.

## GitHub migration
We are currently in the process of migrating the project as OpenSource to GitHub. The first official OpenSource release will be v1.3.0 in a few days.

## When do I need trivrost?
When you need to deploy an always-online desktop application which always needs to be up to date to many users using all three major OSs and all of them expect your software to *just work*.

## What does it look like?

## How does it work?
You release your own build of a trivrost executable to your users. The users start it, causing it to [install and run](docs/lifecycle.md) your software by downloading required files from a webserver administrated by you.

## State of this project
Production-ready, with high confidence for Linux and Windows builds. Has approximately 10.000 active Windows users for one of our builds. MacOS-support [needs input](https://github.com/setlog/trivrost/issues/11).
